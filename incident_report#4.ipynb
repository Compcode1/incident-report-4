    "This morning, the organization experienced a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, where an overwhelming flood of ICMP packets targeted the network. This attack rendered the internal network inaccessible for two hours, impacting all critical network services and internal traffic. The incident was caused by a vulnerability in the network firewall, which lacked proper configuration to filter ICMP packets. The attack disrupted business operations, resulting in downtime and a potential loss of productivity."

    "(Rate limiting is a security measure that controls the number of requests a system accepts within a specified time frame. It ensures that the system does not become overwhelmed by excessive traffic, which could be legitimate (but high volume) or malicious (e.g., during a DDoS attack).\n",

    "Application for Incoming ICMP Packets: In the context of incoming ICMP packets:\n",
    "\n",
    "Rate limiting restricts the number of ICMP packets (e.g., pings) that can be processed by the network or server per second.\n",

Encryption protects sensitive information from unauthorized access during transmission or storage.\n",
